                    "\nIn re Maposa, Cheda J had occasion to deal with a similar situation. In that case an aunt applied to be appointed sole guardian of a minor whose mother had died but the father was alive. The father had, consented to the aunt being appointed sole guardian.

                    " “While the guardianship of a minor child can be granted to one parent to the exclusion of the other, the courts should be slow in granting that status to a third party. The reason is that, the court being the upper guardian of all minors, it should grant guardianship and order subsequent removal from its own jurisdiction only after serious considerations of the circumstances surrounding such application. While the best interests of the child are the first and paramount considerations, they are not the sole consideration in the determination of the suitability of an applicant for guardianship. Other considerations come into play. The wishes of an unimpeachable parent undoubtedly stand first. Although in casu the minor’s father expressed wish was in favour of guardianship by the applicant, the applicant still had to satisfy the court of her suitability as a new parent. She should satisfy the court that she was in a position to adequately look after the child and was a fit and proper person to adopt the child. In that regard the child’s welfare should not be measured only by money or physical comforts, but by all factors that will affect its future. The court should not rely on the applicant’s ability to support the child by her mere say-so in an affidavit; she must go further and convince the court by authentic documentary proof of her capacity to do so…”\n" +

The applicant was a nurse working in the United Kingdom. She sought to be granted guardianship of her late sister’s minor child with the intention of taking the minor with her to the United Kingdom. The father of the minor child was alive and employed in Zimbabwe. The father consented to being divested of his rights of guardianship in favour of the applicant. At p 3 of her judgment GUVAVA J (as she then was) stated that:\n" +

                    "“The Act provides primarily for the situation where a minor has no natural guardian or tutor testamentary and sets out a procedure to allow a third party to be appointed as guardian in their stead. It should be noted that the procedure outlined in s 9 of that Act specifically requires that an inquiry be conducted to determine who should be appointed as guardian. In the case of In re Gonyora 2001 (2) ZLR 573 it was held that in making the appointment of guardian the court must consider the minor child’s best interests. Although in this case the court was dealing with a child whose parents were deceased the same principles must be taken into account even in a case such as this where one of the parents is alive.”\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "The High Court of Zimbabwe as upper guardian of all minor children may refuse to grant a third-party guardianship even in a situation where a natural guardian has agreed to divest guardianship to a third party. The natural guardian has the onus to prove to the court that divesting their rights of guardianship is in the best interests of the minor child.\n" +
                    "A natural guardian’s inability to adequately cater for the children may not be regarded as a sufficient basis to pass guardianship to a third party. The fact that the third party is better resourced than the natural parent is not a sufficient basis to divest the natural guardian of the guardianship of the minors.\n" +

In other words, it is not only an inquiry into the advantages that will accrue to the child if its guardianship is granted to the applicant but also an inquiry into why the respondent must be divested of his guardianship. Thus in my view, an inquiry seeking to divest one parent of guardianship in favour of another or a third party must involve not only an inquiry into why and how the respondent parent must be divested of guardianship but also why the applicant is deemed suitable to be able to discharge those legal obligations that are imposed on natural guardians by law. An inquiry into guardianship is an inquiry into the suitability of a parent to discharge the legal obligations imposed by law on the guardian of a minor child. These issues relate to controlling his estate and assisting them in litigation among other duties. It is not an inquiry into issues like where the child will live or how and where it will be educated as those inquiries relate to issues of custody.”\n" +
